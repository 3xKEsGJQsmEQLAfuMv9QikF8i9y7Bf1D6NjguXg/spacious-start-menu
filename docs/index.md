# Overview

This is a program launcher that allows you to take advantage of the entire screen area.

The full screen listing frees the user from cumbersome scrolling operations.

This program will not replace the `Start Menu`, but the more you use it, the less often you should use the `Start Menu`.

### Why full screen?

In order for the user to perform the task of "launching an application", all the user needs to see is a list of "candidate applications to launch", and there is little need to see any other information in order to perform this task.

Therefore, the choices are deployed across the entire screen so that more information is visible at once.
