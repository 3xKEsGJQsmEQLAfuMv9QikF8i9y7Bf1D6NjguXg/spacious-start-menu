# Overview

This is a program launcher that allows you to take advantage of the entire screen area.

The full screen listing frees the user from cumbersome scrolling operations.

This program will not replace the `Start Menu`, but the more you use it, the less often you should use the `Start Menu`.

### Why full screen?

What the user wants to see in order to accomplish the task of **launching an application** is a list of **candidate applications to launch**, and there is little need for any other information to be visible.

Therefore, the choices are deployed across the entire screen so that more information is visible at once.
